## Usage

1. Git clone this repo or download as .zip `https://github.com/RosieZiutka/rose-pine-polybar.git`
2. Comment out (using ";;") or delete your current colors in config file.
3. Add something like following line to your polybar config file: `include-file = ~/Path-to-where-you-downloaded/theme-name.ini`, of course replace those with real path and file names

**NOTE** It would be good practice if you copied your file to `.config/polybar/` instead of using the path you downloaded.

- Lowercase meta files, eg. `readme.md`

- Add a description and topics to automatically show the theme on [rosepinetheme.com/themes](https://rosepinetheme.com/themes)
    - Description should read "Soho vibes for App" where "App" is the display name
    - Topics should include "theme" as well as any other categories. See [existing categories](https://rosepinetheme.com/themes), only adding new ones when necessary
- Generate and upload social image via [RosÃ© Pine Images](https://rose-pine-images.vercel.app)
